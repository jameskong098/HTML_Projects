This website is a price elasticity of demand calculator. Input a initial Pe number value, initial Qe number value, new Pe number value, new Qe number value, and you will get the price elasticity of demand value along with whether or not demand is more elastic or inelastic. There may be an error if the program ever has to divide by zero so be careful with input. 

This project was made for fun, as I have always found web development interesting since its the easiest to show others. It's always fun to make cool projects that I can actually show to someone and not just have it be a console all the time. My dad used to always be like "When can you show me a website or a GUI?" and I kind of understand him. Your average person is not going to care about a console output but something with a GUI like a website is understandable by most people. Additionally, I am also taking intro to microeconomics right now because I am thinking of minoring in business so making this project is also relevant to my coursework in that class. Who knows, maybe I'll actually use this website to check my answers. 

Anyways, hope you enjoy this little side project. If I have more time, I might decide to make more calculators for different types of elasticity and etc.
